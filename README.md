Use with ImageMagick to live life in the world of cool gifs (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php)

I don't know how to make fancy README files

If you run it once you will get 100 images named savedX.png. It takes a while, so give it a while. It makes 100 images so you can then make them into a gif. If someone wants to make a bash script that does that, please do.
